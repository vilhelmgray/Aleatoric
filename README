About

Aleatoric is an aleatoric music composition.

Every 250 milliseconds, Aleatoric chooses a random note in the key of A
Major and plays it until the next note is chosen. Furthermore, every
second, three distinct notes are chosen at random to form a trichord
which is sustained until the next trichord is chosen. The componsition
continues ad infinitum.
